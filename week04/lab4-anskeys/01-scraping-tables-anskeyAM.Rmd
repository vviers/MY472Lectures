### Scraping web data in table format

We will start by loading the `rvest` package, which will help us scrape data from the web.

```{r}
library(rvest)
```

The goal of this exercise is to scrape the number of new social security number holders by year in the US, and then clean it so that we can generate a plot showing the evolution in this variable over time.

The first step is to read the html code from the website we want to scrape, using the `read_html()` function. If we want to see the html in text format, we can then use `html_text()`.

```{r}
url <- "https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/numberUSbirths.html"
# reading the html code into memory
html_content <- read_html(url)
# not very informative
print(html_content)
# first 1000 characters
substr(html_content, 1, 1000)

```

To extract all the tables in the html code automatically, we use `html_table()`. Note that it returns a list of data frames, so in order to work with this dataset, we will have to subset the second element of this list.

```{r}
tab <- html_table(html_content, fill = TRUE)
# check the tables
length(tab)
str(tab)
# use the population tables
data_pop <- tab[[2]]
```

Now let's clean the data so that we can use it for our analysis. We need to convert the population values into a numeric format, which requires deleting the commas. We will also change the variable names so that it's easier to work with them.

```{r}
## remove commas and then make variable numeric
data_pop$Male <-  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data_pop$Male))
data_pop$Female <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data_pop$Female))
data_pop$Total <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data_pop$Total))

## rename variables
names(data_pop) <- c('year', 'male', 'female', 'total')
```

And now we can plot to see how the number of people applying for a Social Security Number in the US has increased over time.

```{r}
plot(data_pop$year, data_pop$male, type = 'l', col = 'red')
lines(data_pop$year, data_pop$female, col = 'blue')
legend(x = 'topleft', col = c("red", "blue"), lty = 1, legend = c("male", "female"))

## or ggplot
## ggplot requires the data to be in tidy shape. for that we use 
## melt() function in reshape2
library(ggplot2)
data_pop_melt <- reshape2::melt(data_pop[, 1:3], id.vars = "year")
ggplot(data_pop_melt) + aes(x = year, y = value, group = variable, colour = variable) + 
  geom_line() + scale_y_log10()


```

### Scraping web data in table format: a more advanced example

When there are multiple tables on the website, scraping them becomes a bit more complicated. Let's work through a common case scenario: scraping a table from Wikipedia with a list of the most populated cities in the United States.

```{r}
url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population'
html <- read_html(url)
tables <- html_table(html, fill=TRUE)
length(tables)
```

The function now returns 12 different tables. I had to use the option `fill=TRUE` because some of the tables appear to have incomplete rows.

In this case, identifying the part of the html code that contains the table is a better approach. To do so, let's take a look at the source code of the website. In Google Chrome, go to _View_ > _Developer_ > _View Source_. All browsers should have similar options to view the source code of a website.

In the source code, search for the text of the page (e.g. _2017 rank_). Right above it you will see: `<table class="wikitable sortable"...">`. This is the CSS selector that contains the table. (You can also find this information by right-clicking anywhere on the table, and choosing _Inspect_).

Now that we now what we're looking for, let's use `html_nodes()` to identify all the elements of the page that have that CSS class. (Note that we need to use a dot before the name of the class to indicate it's CSS.)

```{r}
wiki <- html_nodes(html, '.wikitable')
length(wiki)
```

There are 7 tables in total, and we will extract the first one.
```{r}
data_pop <- html_table(wiki[[2]])
str(data_pop)
```

As in the previous case, we still need to clean the data before we can use it. For this particular example, let's see if this dataset provides evidence in support of [Zipf's law for population ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

We'll use regular expressions to remove endnotes and commas in the population numbers, and clean the variable names. (We'll come back to this later in the course.)

```{r}
data_pop$city_name <- gsub('\\[.*\\]', '', data_pop$City)
data_pop$population <- data_pop[,"2017estimate"]
data_pop$population <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data_pop$population))
data_pop$rank <- data_pop[,"2017rank"]
data_pop <- data_pop[,c("rank", "population", "city_name")]
```

Now we're ready to generate the figure:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data_pop, aes(x=rank, y=population, label=city_name))
pq <- p + geom_point() + geom_text(hjust=-.1, size=3) +
	scale_x_log10("log(rank)") + 
  scale_y_log10("log(population)", labels=scales::comma) +
  theme_minimal()
pq
```

We can also check if this distribution follows Zipf's law estimating a log-log regression.
```{r}
summary(lm(log(rank) ~ log(population), data = data_pop))
```
